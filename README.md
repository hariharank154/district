## DevTools Usage for Educational Purposes

I use browser developer tools (**DevTools**) to explore and understand how modern websites are built and optimized. This includes collecting and studying source files such as images, stylesheets, JavaScript files, and metadata â€” **strictly for educational and non-commercial use**.

### My Goals:

- Learn how websites use **preload**, **lazy loading**, and **CDNs** to improve performance.
- Understand how assets are structured and served in real-world applications.
- Analyze **responsive design practices**, **file naming conventions**, and **asset optimization techniques**.
